Stamps a version into `package.json` and publishes the package to an
npm registry, such as a Linux Foundation Nexus instance.

## node-publish-action

The action wraps the production-proven Linux Foundation publish flow:

```text
npm version <X> --no-git-tag-version && npm publish
```

It composes
[node-create-npmrc-action](https://github.com/lfreleng-actions/node-create-npmrc-action)
for registry authentication, keeping publish `run:` logic out of
calling workflows. Versions get stamped at publish time, matching the
merge-driven release model where committed metadata (such as
`version.properties`), not the committed `package.json`, provides the
version.

## Usage Example

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->

```yaml
steps:
  - name: "Publish npm package"
    id: publish
    uses: lfreleng-actions/node-publish-action@main
    with:
      publish_version: '1.2.3-SNAPSHOT'
      registry_url: 'https://nexus3.example.org/repository/npm.snapshot/'
      load_credential: 'true'
      vault_mapping_json: ${{ secrets.VAULT_MAPPING_JSON }}
      op_service_account_token: ${{ secrets.OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN }}
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD046 -->

## Requirements

The action needs `jq`, `realpath` (GNU coreutils, including `-m`
support) and `mktemp` on the runner. GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runners
include these tools; minimal self-hosted or non-Linux runners must
provide them. The action checks for them up front and fails with a
clear error naming any missing tool. It installs Node.js and npm via
the pinned `actions/setup-node` action, without dependency caching.
Real publishes need egress to the target registry; dry-run mode
performs no registry interaction.

### Input Character Allowlists

The action checks free-text inputs against strict whole-string
character allowlists before use, rejecting shell metacharacters and
embedded newlines:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

| Input           | Allowed                | Structure                                                         |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| publish_version | `0-9 A-Za-z . -`       | All-digit `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` segments plus an optional `-`suffix |
| registry_url    | `A-Za-z 0-9 . : / _ -` | `https://` scheme, non-empty host, trailing `/`, no userinfo      |
| tag             | `A-Za-z 0-9 . _ -`     | Non-empty                                                         |
| node_version    | `A-Za-z 0-9 . * / _ -` | Follows setup-node version syntax                                 |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

The `nexus_user`, `scope` and credential inputs pass through to
`node-create-npmrc-action`, which applies its own validation.

## Outputs

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

| Name              | Description                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| published_version | Version stamped into `package.json` and published  |
| package_name      | Package name from the publish metadata             |
| tarball_name      | Tarball filename from the publish metadata         |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

## Behaviour

1. **Check inputs**: tests every input against its allowlist; real
   publishes need `registry_url` and a credential source as well,
   failing fast with a clear error otherwise. With
   `load_credential: 'true'`, real publishes need non-empty
   `vault_mapping_json` and `op_service_account_token` values too
2. **Authenticate** (real publishes): `node-create-npmrc-action`
   writes an authenticated `.npmrc` into the project directory
3. **Stamp**: `npm version <X> --no-git-tag-version
   --allow-same-version --ignore-scripts` updates `package.json`,
   with the result read back and verified. A `::notice::` names any
   `preversion`/`version`/`postversion` scripts the project defines,
   since `--ignore-scripts` means they do not run
4. **Publish**: `npm publish --json` with the configured tag, access
   and provenance flags; the action parses the JSON metadata and
   verifies the published version matches the request
5. **Verify** (real publishes): `npm view <name>@<version>` against
   the target registry confirms availability; an unreadable package
   downgrades to a warning (registries may restrict anonymous reads
   or index asynchronously), while a readable package with the wrong
   version fails the action

## Dry-Run Mode

With `dry_run: 'true'` the action runs `npm publish --dry-run`, which
packs the package and reports the metadata without any registry
interaction. Dry-run mode skips the `.npmrc`/credential steps
entirely, so it needs no `registry_url` and no credential inputs.
Every test in this repository's testing workflow runs in dry-run
mode; CI holds no registry credentials.

## Authentication Modes

Three mutually exclusive modes. Supplying more than one fails the
action rather than picking a winner, since the effective credential
would otherwise be ambiguous.

### Basic auth (Nexus)

Pass `nexus_password` directly, or set `load_credential: 'true'` with
`vault_mapping_json` and `op_service_account_token` to fetch it from
1Password. `node-create-npmrc-action` writes an `_auth` entry holding
`base64(username:password)`.

### Bearer token

Pass `auth_token`. Written as an `_authToken` entry. Registries that
reject Basic auth for publishing, notably `registry.npmjs.org`,
require this form.

`nexus_user` plays no part in token or OIDC publishing, since neither
carries a username. Setting it alongside either mode is inert rather
than an error — callers that compute it unconditionally, such as a
matrix publishing to both Nexus and npmjs.org, would otherwise have
to strip it per target. The action emits a `::notice::` naming it as
ignored.

### OIDC trusted publishing

Set `oidc: 'true'`. The action stores no credential anywhere: npm
exchanges a GitHub OIDC token for a short-lived publish token, and
generates provenance itself.

The action preflights two of the requirements, failing before any
registry interaction:

- `id-token: write` on the calling job, detected via the token
  endpoint. With `workflow_call`, npm needs the grant on **both** the
  caller and the called workflow
- npm >= 11.5.1 **and** Node >= 22.14.0. Meeting the Node floor does
  not meet the npm one — Node 22 ships npm 10.x, and even Node 24.0.0
  ships npm 11.3.0 — so run a step such as `npm install -g npm@^11`
  beforehand. The action reports this rather than upgrading npm
  behind your back

npm enforces the rest at publish time, and the action cannot check
them in advance:

- GitHub-hosted runners; npm does not support self-hosted runners
  for trusted publishing
- The package's `repository.url` must match the GitHub repository
- npm validates the **calling** workflow's filename, so register the
  trusted publisher against the caller (for example
  `gerrit-merge.yaml`), not the reusable workflow

Provenance is not generated for packages published from private
repositories, even when the package itself is public.

## Credential Handling

`node-create-npmrc-action` masks the credential material, writes the
`.npmrc` with restrictive permissions and registers a guaranteed
post-job step that scrubs the file again — including when later steps
fail. This action adds no duplicate cleanup logic.

OIDC skips that machinery entirely: the action writes nothing, so no
file needs scrubbing.

## Provenance

The `provenance` input passes `--provenance` to npm, generating
registry-native Sigstore provenance. This works against registries
with provenance support (npmjs.org) and requires an OIDC token
(`id-token: write` permission). Nexus has no provenance support, so
leave the input at `false` for Nexus targets; generate GitHub
artifact attestations for the packed tarball instead.

With `oidc: 'true'` the flag is redundant, because npm generates
provenance for trusted publishes on its own. The action rejects the
combination rather than passing a flag whose effect is already
implied.

## Path Constraints

Relative values for `path_prefix` resolve against `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`,
not the current working directory, so behaviour stays deterministic
when a calling workflow sets a custom working directory. The project
directory must resolve within `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` and contain a
`package.json`; the boundary check re-runs in every later step that
touches the path. Paths that escape the workspace fail the action.

## Notes

- The action performs no dependency caching, in line with the
  organisation's cache-poisoning stance
- `--allow-same-version` keeps re-stamping idempotent when the
  committed `package.json` version already matches the request
- Stamping uses `--ignore-scripts`, so `preversion`, `version` and
  `postversion` do not run. No release lane installs dependencies
  before stamping, so a hook invoking the test or build script could
  not succeed; suppressing them keeps the merge-driven and tag-driven
  lanes producing the same tree. The action emits a `::notice::`
  naming the skipped scripts, because a dependency-free `version`
  hook (writing the version into a source constant, say) would
  otherwise go missing from the published package with no signal
- Publishing runs `prepublishOnly`/`prepack`/`prepare` scripts when
  the project defines them; run builds beforehand (for example via
  [node-build-action](https://github.com/lfreleng-actions/node-build-action))
  so the packed content is complete
